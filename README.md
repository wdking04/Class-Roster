# Class-Roster
C++ Scripting and Programming Applications Project

This project was based on a rubric to demonstrate an understanding of object oriented programming principles.
Write a program containing five classes (i.e., Student , SecurityStudent , NetworkStudent , SoftwareStudent , and Roster ). The program will maintain a current roster of students within a given course. Student data for the program includes student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree. This information can be found in the studentData table below. The program will read a list of five students and use function calls to manipulate data. While parsing the list of data, the program should create student objects using the appropriate subclasses indicated by the degree program. The entire student list will be stored in one array of students called classRosterArray Specific data-related output will be directed to the console.
